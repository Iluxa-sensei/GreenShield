## GreenShield Web Platform

GreenShield is an environmental monitoring project focused on detecting poisonous plants and analyzing soil types using drone imagery, AI models, and geolocation data. This repository contains the source code for the GreenShield web platform, which serves as a visualization and analytics interface for environmental data collected through the system.


## Features
 • Interactive map with geotagged plant and soil data
 • Display of toxic plant detections and soil classifications
 • Integration with AI models (YOLOv8 + PyTorch/FastAI)
 • User-friendly dashboard for researchers, farmers, and environmental agencies
 • Responsive design, optimized for desktop and mobile

## Technology Stack
 • HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 • Leaflet.js (for mapping)
 • Chart.js or D3.js (for data visualization)
 • Firebase / REST API (optional for real-time updates)
